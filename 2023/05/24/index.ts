/**
 * This problem was asked by Facebook.
 * 
 * A builder is looking to build a row of `N` houses that can be of `K` different colors.
 * He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.
 * 
 * Given an `N` by `K` matrix where the `nᵗʰ` row and `kᵗʰ` column represents the cost to build the `nᵗʰ` house
 * with `kᵗʰ` color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.
